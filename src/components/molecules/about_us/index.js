          Coasters are one of the most effective ways of doing marketing. People
          will never toss away a coaster like flyer as a coaster always has a
          use case. Why print flyers anyway, when the same information can be on
          a coaster even a coaster is 4x cheaper, has a use case and are
          ecofriendly! After a phone and a glass, a coaster is the third most
          viewed item inside an establishment. This means coasters are an ideal
          tool to advertise your business information on.
